## Project

This project was undertaken during a [Rockeseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) event, where participants were tasked with building a React application from scratch in just 3 days.
The project idea was to build a web app that stores local notes that can be written or recorded. It is possible to create and delete notes.

### Project Overview
This project provided a comprehensive hands-on experience with React development, covering fundamental concepts and advanced features within a short timeframe.
During the event, the following steps were taken to develop the project:

#### Project Setup:

- Established the project setup using Vite and Tailwind.

#### Initial Interface Development:

- Initiated the static development of the interface.
- Introduced the fundamental concept of React: componentization.

####  React Core Concepts:

- Explored and implemented the concepts of properties and state in React.
- Utilized Radix UI library for modal usage.
- Integrated date-fns library for effective date handling.
- Incorporated Sonner library for displaying toasts.

#### Advanced Features:

- Implemented the SpeechRecognition API to convert user audio into notes.
- Applied the Lifting State Up concept for effective note management.
- Achieved data persistence using LocalStorage.

#### Technologies and Libraries Used:

- Vite
- Tailwind
